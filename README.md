# Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications Programming Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to many of the programming exercises in Judson's Abstract Algebra textbook (AATA), which is often used in Modern Algebra and Group Theory courses. 

All of my solutions are original. As far as I know, these are the set of solutions to these exercises available online. 

There are two main purposes of this repository:
1) is help those who are having trouble with these problems and
2) is to display my knowledge of abstract algebra. 

All of the solutions should contain the original problem as well as my idea for how to solve the problem. If there's any errors, please let me know.
